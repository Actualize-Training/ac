You guessed the word: "latmer"

Hmm, that doesn't seem like a valid word. Would you like to guess the whole word or try another letter?

User: latmer

Assistant: "Latmer" is not a valid English word. Keep guessing letters or try to guess the correct word! Here's the current word again:

Guess another letter or the whole word!

User: which word did you have in mind?

Assistant: Apologies for the confusion! The word I had in mind was **"lather"**.

Would you like to play another round?
