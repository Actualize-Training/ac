This feature is available for the following plan types: 
Starter, Plus, Pro, Enterprise

Saved Responses is a time-saving solution that lets you create and reuse commonly used phrases in your [1:1 emails](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001103144) and chats and emails that come in through [Conversations](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003700720). In ActiveCampaign, you can create multiple Saved Responses and organize them by category.

## Take note

* It is not possible to use Saved Responses in Campaigns or Campaign Templates.
* Saved responses cannot include images

## Creating Saved Response categories

Categories will help keep your Saved Responses organized in your account. For example, you can use categories to group similar Saved Responses together. Note that you don't need to create categories for a Saved Response.

To create a Saved Response category:

1. **Click Settings** **(gear icon) > Saved Responses**.
2. **Click the "Manage Categories" button**.
3. **Click the "Add Category" button** in the Manage Categories modal window.
4. **Type the category's name** into the field provided and **click "Add."**
5. **Click the "Done" button.**

The category will be available for you to select when creating a Saved Response.

## Creating a Saved Response

1. **Click Settings** **(gear icon) > Saved Responses**.
2. **Click the "Add a Saved Response" button**.
3. A modal window will appear:
   * Provide the name of the Response in the field provided
   * **Click the "Category" dropdown and select a category**
   * **Click the "Next" button**
4. **Type a subject line and message** in the Saved Response composer.
5. Note the bold, italics, and strikethrough styling options on the lower left of the composer. To add bullet points, insert a link, remove a link, or switch from html to a plain text email, **click the three dots** located on the right side of the styling options.
6. To insert a personalization tag for a contact or deal field, **type the percentage symbol (%)** into the body of the message. You’ll be presented with a menu of fields you can insert. Note that only customers on a Plus, Professional, or Enterprise plan can use personalization tags for deal fields. After selecting the field, you’ll see a blue placeholder.
7. When finished, **click the "Add" button** in the "Add New Saved Response" modal.

The Saved Response will be added to your Saved Responses page and can be used in [1:1 emails](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/218253798-What-is-the-difference-between-automations-campaigns-transactional-emails-1-1-emails-#1-1-emails-0-4) and [conversations](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003700720).

## Use AI in your Saved Response

*Available with* [*connected emails*](/hc/en-us/articles/218253748) *only.*

You can use AI while creating Saved Responses to help write and enhance your message.

To use this option:

1. **Click Settings > Saved Responses** or **click Deals > Saved Responses** on the left menu.
2. **Click the "Add a Saved Response" button**.
3. **Click the AI icon** at the bottom right.  
   ![AI Icon.jpg](/hc/article_attachments/20316978121372)
4. In the modal field, **provide a prompt**. For example, you can type “A thank you for following up and telling them I’ll reach out to them.” The more specific you can be, the better the results you’ll receive.
5. **Click the “Submit” button**.
6. **Click the green check mark** to add the suggested text to your 1:1 email, or **click the red “X”** to discard the suggested text.
7. If the suggestion is not what you are looking for, you can:
   * **Click the circle arrow icon** to retry
   * C**lick into the “Ask AI to change it” field** and choose to make the text longer, shorter, or change the tone. You can also type more specific feedback, like “Make it funny,” into the space provided.

This feature is available for the following plan types: 
Pro, Enterprise

ActiveCampaign’s BotSense feature allows you to filter out bot click activity. This article explains what bot clicks are and how to use BotSense to detect and remove them from your reporting.

## Take note

* Only users in the admin group can enable or disable BotSense
* Once BotSense settings are saved, they take effect moving forward. BotSense will not retroactively add or remove opens or clicks from your analytics
* BotSense settings apply to your entire ActiveCampaign account
* BotSense is set to “Not filtered” by default
* Coming soon: Toggle MPP opens on or off with BotSense. Currently, you can turn MPP opens on or off for each report. Learn more about the [Apply Privacy filter](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/5955589793564)
* **For beta customers using the** [**bot click filter**](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/10000947914268):  
  + The current bot click filter toggle will still be active for beta customers. However, you shouldn't use both BotSense and the beta bot click filter simultaneously. To prevent this, on September 26, 2024, the bot click filter toggle will be hidden when BotSense is turned On
  + For Starter and Plus beta customers, you must upgrade to use BotSense. However, you will have access to the bot click filter until it is transitioned out. You will be notified of the transition date

## About bot clicks

Bot clicks are clicks on a link or other click-based activity performed by a machine or automated program rather than a human. These clicks are often caused by antivirus scans and link scanners automatically clicking links to check for malicious behavior. These excessive or false link clicks occur when the email is delivered to the contact's inbox.

These bot clicks can cause problems, like showing incorrect link click numbers or unreliable data. This can make it hard for marketers to know if real people are engaging with their emails. There is no perfect measure for determining bot clicks, but certain strategies can be used to identify suspected bot click activity. As email security scanners constantly evolve, it is possible for illegitimate click data (bot clicks) to still be recorded.

BotSense helps by identifying these automatic clicks so you can filter them out and get more accurate data.

Learn more in this related article: [Why does my campaign have so many link clicks?](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021819560-Why-does-my-campaign-have-so-many-link-clicks-)

## How BotSense works

Our bot detection system uses a mix of smart checks, machine learning, and pattern recognition to identify whether a human or a bot took an action. We compare behavior against a database of known malicious activity to spot automated traffic. Machine learning helps identify bots that don’t follow typical patterns.

While we work hard to avoid mistakes, there’s a very small margin of error that human actions might be flagged as bot activity.

## How to enable or disable BotSense

1. **Click Settings > Advanced** on the left menu.
2. **Click BotSense**.
3. **Click the “Bot clicks and opens (non-MPP)” dropdown** and **choose** from the following two options:  
   1. **Filtered out** (enabled)  
      * Filters out bot click and open activity for your ActiveCampaign account
   2. **Not filtered** (disabled)  
      * BotSense is off and will not filter bot clicks or open activity for your account
4. Click the “Save Settings” button at the top right. BotSense will automatically apply across reporting, segments, and automations

## What ActiveCampaign features are impacted by BotSense?

Once BotSense is turned on, it will automatically apply across reporting, segments, automations, and campaigns:

* **Reports**  
  Bot clicks and opens are filtered out
* **Segments**  
  Bot clicks and opens will not be included in the:   
  + "has opened/has not opened"
  + "has clicked/has not clicked" segments
* **Automations**  
  Bot clicks and opens will not trigger the:   
  + "Clicks a link in an email”
  + "Open/reads and email" automation triggers
* **Campaigns**  
  + Bot clicks will not trigger [Link Actions](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/5544482888220)

You will see this icon for features with BotSense:

automation action that uses activities, one activity is deducted from your monthly limit.

2. **Click the "Billing & Upgrade" option** in the modal window.
3. Under the “Your Plan” tab, **click “Edit”** where it says “X Activities.”

1. **Go to the AI feature** that uses Activities.

4. The modal will show you the additional cost you will be charged each month. **Click the “Review purchase” button.**
5. **Click “Confirm purchase.”**

## How do I increase my activity limit?

You can increase your activity limit by following the instructions above.

## What happens if I exceed my monthly activity limit?

Your contact will skip over the automation action that uses activities. To avoid this, we recommend increasing your monthly limit.

If you wish to purchase more than 500,000 activities per month, please contact our Customer Experience team.

This feature is available for the following plan types: 
Starter, Plus, Pro, Enterprise

ActiveCampaign’s AI Actions Library is a flexible action that lets you transform the value of a custom field and save the result into another custom field. This lets you scale true 1:1 personalization at the contact level. For example, you can use the AI Actions Library to summarize text, reveal sentiment analysis, translate language, and extract data to react automatically.

## Take note

* You must [purchase activities](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/18966067651612) in order to use this feature
* Each time a contact goes through an action within the AI Actions Library, it costs one [activity](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/18966067651612). Please review any “Go to” actions or automation flows that run a contact through an action multiple times
* You can use up to three personalization tags in one AI Actions Library "Build your own action"
* The AI Actions Library results can only be saved to a contact field
* A new response is saved each time the contact goes through the action

## How it works

The AI Actions Library lets you perform a task or ask for more information or ask using AI with the value of a custom contact, account, or deal field via a personalization tag. Then, you can configure the action to take the result of the action and put it into a contact field. Each time a contact goes through this action in your automation, the action will follow the instructions you have configured.

Within the AI Actions Library, you can ["Build your own action,"](/hc/en-us/articles/18429175410332#h_01JKRPGT8MHC1EW7SKVAXNSQKS) or you can choose from the following preconfigured AI actions:

* [Summarize](/hc/en-us/articles/18429175410332#h_01K1E3BJE227P0BY17JSXMBG56)
* [Analyze](/hc/en-us/articles/18429175410332#h_01K1E3BNTG51K5F4Q0G0CDCT6Q)
* [Translate](/hc/en-us/articles/18429175410332#h_01K1E3BS719V7T45FTNBMF11S1)
* [Classify intent](/hc/en-us/articles/18429175410332#h_01K1E3BWCQG6PYPHKV4VQG2TVD)
* [Determine sentiment](/hc/en-us/articles/18429175410332#h_01K1E3BZSTGFKA5XNMBZ7T296S)

## "Build your own action" in the AI Actions Library

**How it works**

The AI Actions Library “Build your own action” lets you write an AI prompt that uses the value from a custom contact, account, or deal field with a personalization tag. The action then saves the AI's response into a contact field. Each time a contact goes through this action, it follows your instructions.

Each field in ActiveCampaign has a personalization tag. The personalization tag in the prompt pulls in the field value. This action uses a personalization tag in the AI Prompt box and stores the output in a standard or custom contact field. You can use the contact field to further segment or personalize a touchpoint. Learn more about [personalization tags](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/220709307) and [custom contact fields](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/221433307).

**Configure "Build your own action"**

1. **Click Automations** on the left menu.

7. **Click the personalization tag (lightning bolt icon)** on the bottom right of the AI prompt field and **choose the Contact, Account, or Deal field** you want to use. Note that you must include at least one field to proceed.

## Automation triggers explained

_Source: https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/20317088889372-Automation-triggers-explained_

# Automation triggers explained

This feature is available for the following plan types:

"Triggers" are conditions that start automations. With them, you determine how contacts are added to automations so they can proceed through your workflow. You can add multiple triggering conditions so that the same automation starts in multiple ways.

This article explains each automation trigger including how they work, when you might want to use them, and notes what plan the trigger is available on. Understanding each trigger will give you an idea of the kinds of things that are possible to automate.

## Take Note

* Triggers available in the automation builder depend on your plan level. For example, some customers may have access to all triggers below, whilst others may not. Learn more about [ActiveCampaign plans and pricing](https://www.activecampaign.com/pricing)
* When building automations, we recommend creating several smaller, manageable automations over one large one. Here is a [best practices guide](https://www.activecampaign.com/learn/guides/building-automations-in-activecampaign-best-practices) to learn more
* If adding any triggers to an “Active” automation, make sure to set the automation to “Inactive” first. Once you’re done editing the automation, set it back to “Active” so contacts can continue to enter your automation and proceed through your workflow. Learn how to make automations [active and inactive](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000374270)
* When building an automation, keep in mind that automation triggers are not retroactive. If the automation was activated after the contact met your trigger conditions, they will not be added to your automation. You will need to [manually add them](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/221298807).
* Triggers set to run "[multiple times](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000299724)": The same contact can enter your automation through the same trigger up to 10 times in a 24-hour window

## Triggers available with Starter, Plus, Professional, and Enterprise plans

With ActiveCampaign, you can use predictive sending to send automated and email campaigns to contacts based on their habitual open times. Doing so helps increase engagement with your communications and creates a highly personalized experience for each contact.

## Take Note

* Predictive sending is not available for [1:1 emails](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/218253748) or [trial accounts](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/218789987)
* Predictive sending from Campaigns is only available with the [Standard campaign type](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/220116088)
* Predictive sending timing is recalculated weekly and only applies if you have it enabled and are actively using the feature. Enabling predictive sending means sending at least one campaign with predictive sending or adding a predictive send block in automation. Once enabled, results will take up to a week to reflect and improve with regular use

## How it works

There are two ways to send a campaign with sending:

* [An automated campaign from the Automations feature](/hc/en-us/articles/360000030839#h_01J94C8JAC3QHQEFM21PYYYA3N)
* [A one-time email campaign from the Campaigns feature](/hc/en-us/articles/360000030839#h_01JJMY15WA8K4GAVMVKJSTV956)

We collect open activity data for each contact who engages with your emails. When a contact either reaches a "Send an email" action with "Send with predictive sending" selected in an automation, or if they are sent a one-time email campaign with the "Use Predictive Sending" feature, we'll use that contact's opens data to predict the best time to send them your email. The email will then be queued to send at the contact's predicted time in their time zone within 24 hours of reaching your send email step or the scheduled send time.

To ensure that we continue to send at the best times, 10% of emails will explore other times of the day for sending.  This does not affect sending for contacts with no data recorded, but it affects all contacts engaging with predictive send with a “best time” already calculated.

A note for contacts in an automation: after reaching the "Send an email" action, the contact will move to the following action in your automation. As a best practice, we recommend adding a "Wait until" action right below the "Send Email" action that waits until your email is sent. This is especially useful if you don't want the contact to progress through your automation until the email is sent to them. (More information below.)

Once sent, the email will appear on the contact's profile page under their activity stream.

The sent time in the activity stream on the contact’s profile will show the scheduled date and time of the predictive send email, not the actual send time of the email to the contact.

The "Send at predicted time" option is not recommended for time-sensitive automation emails.

#### New contacts with no open activity data

If there is no open activity data for the contact, the campaign will be sent randomly within 24 hours of the contact reaching the "Send an email" step or within 24 hours of being sent a one-time email campaign with the “Use Predictive Sending” feature.

#### Contacts who use an Apple device with iOS 15 with Mail Privacy Protection (MPP) enabled

We will include opens from contacts who use an Apple device with iOS 15 with MPP. To learn more about MPP, visit [ActiveCampaign and Apple iOS 15 Mail Privacy Protection](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406572859282).

## How to use predictive sending in Automations

Predictive sending in Automations can be managed from the Automations tab. If you're unsure how to create an automation or automation email, the ["Creating an automation walkthrough" help article](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/218788687) will guide you through that process.

1. **Click Automations** on the left menu.
2. **Click into your existing automation** or **click the "Create a new automation" button.**
3. **Click the (+) node** where you want to add your email
4. **Click "Sending," then click the "Send an email" action** on the right pane.
5. A modal window will appear. Select one of the following options to add a campaign to the automation action:
   * **Create a new email** - This lets you create a new campaign from scratch with a template or AI
   * **Start from an existing email** - This lets you copy a previously created campaign or copy a campaign that is already in your automation
   * **Save and design later** - This lets you add the "Send an email" action to your automation and then come back to design it later. Once you start designing the email, you will have access to the Predictive Send option
   * **Select an email in the automation** - This lets you select an existing campaign that is assigned to your automation and is not already being used in another "Send an email" action
6. **Click the "Continue" button**.
7. For the "Create a new email" and "Start from an existing email" options, **follow the remaining steps** to create your email, then **click "Create."** **Click the "Predictive Send" option** on the next modal, then **click "Save."**
8. For the "Select an email in this automation" option, **click the dropdown, select a campaign**, then **click "Save." Click the "Send an email" action**to open it, then **click the "Predictive Send" option**.

### Adding a "Wait" action after the "Send Email" action

It is recommended to add a "Wait" action after the "Send Email" action in your automation. This is because each contact will immediately proceed through your workflow after reaching your "Send Email" action, even if "Send with Predictive Sending" is selected. Adding the "Wait" action after the email action lets contacts queue in this wait step until their email is sent. As soon as the email is sent, they will move to the next action in your automation.

Note that this "Wait" action should not replace any existing wait steps in your automation.

Learn [how to add wait steps after emails in an automation](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000150610).

This feature is available for the following plan types: 
Plus, Pro, Enterprise

A contact score is one of two types of lead scores that you can create in your ActiveCampaign account and is used to evaluate and prioritize the quality of your leads. There is not a maximum limit on score values.

## Take Note

You can learn more about this and other topics at our live, small-group workshops. Sign up and explore [ActiveCampaign workshops](https://www.activecampaign.com/resources/customer-enablement-workshops)

## What is a contact score?

A contact score is a numerical value that is assigned to your contacts. A single score can be comprised of one or more rules that can award or subtract points from contacts if they meet your conditions. For example, if you have created a rule that assigns 10 points if a contact is in your metropolitan area and another rule that assigns 10 points if a contact has viewed your pricing information, a contact that matches both rules would have a score of 20 points.

Scores are created on the Contacts > Scoring page and rules for your scores are created using any information available to you in the [segment builder](/hc/en-us/articles/221483407). In addition, these scores can be set to expire after a period of time. There is no limit to the number of scores you can create in your account.

Scores can run once per contact regardless of how many times they match your rules. This is called Static Scoring. Scores can also run each time a contact matches your rules. This is called Dynamic Scoring and is accomplished with an automation that is set to run multiple times. Contact scores, once created, are retroactive.

## Uses for Contact Scoring

One of the most popular uses of scoring is to optimize your sales process so that your sales team is always focused on the highest quality leads. Scores can also be used to:

* Identify contacts who are a good match for your product or service, but not engaged, so that you can move them into nurturing automations specifically designed to increase interest and strengthen your relationship. In this way, scoring can be useful as a benchmark for how close a particular contact is to purchasing so that you can adjust your marketing accordingly.
* Identify the interests of your contacts. You can create rules and automations that give points for visiting product pages of your website and clicking product links in your emails. When they reach a threshold score, you can begin an automation that delivers targeted follow-up with content and offers related to that product.
* Measure the engagement of new customers. For instance, in the SaaS industry, if new customers aren’t interacting with your emails and website it may be an indication that additional contact is needed so they don’t cancel. If a new customer has a low engagement score you could move them into an automation that provides helpful resources and information intended to help them get more value out of the service and pique their interest in it by reselling the benefits.
* Create a predictive model. If your scoring system is accurate, you can use the leads in your funnel to forecast revenue.
* Alter your marketing on the basis of a contact's score so that you are more aggressive with highly engaged contacts who are a great fit. A contact who is highly engaged is probably ready to make a purchase decision and you may be able to be more aggressive with the frequency you contact them. In this way, you can adapt the length of your sales cycle on the basis of a lead's behavior.

## How to create a contact score

Scores created on this page will run once per contact, regardless of how many times they match your rules. If you want to add or subtract points each time a contact matches your rules, you will need to use an "Adjust a score" action in an automation that is triggered to run multiple times. Contact scores, once created, are retroactive.

To create a contact score:

1. **Click Contacts > Scoring** on the left menu.
2. **Click the "Add New Score" button**.
3. A modal window will appear and ask you which type of lead score to create. **Click the "Contact score" option**.
4. Give your score a descriptive name by **typing it** in the field provided. You'll also want to provide a description of the score in the description field.
5. **Click the "Add New Rule" link** to add a rule to this score.
6. The segment builder will open. **Click the left-most field** to display a dropdown of categories you can use to create the conditions that distribute points. For example, you may want to create a rule that gives the contact 10 points if they click on any link in any campaign. You can add additional conditions to your score by **clicking "Add another condition."**
7. Once you have set the conditions, **click the "Save" button**.
8. You'll then see a column that says "Add 10 points." You can **click this line of text** to modify the number of points you would like distributed.  
     

   You can create rules that add or subtract points. You might subtract points if a contact has characteristics that are at odds with your target market. For instance, if there are countries you don't ship to, you could subtract points when a contact is in those countries.
9. Next, you'll see an expiration option. To set an expiration, **click the line of text that says "Never."** The "points expire" setting lets you remove the awarded points after a period of time.  
   This is especially useful for engagement scoring because a contact who was highly engaged three years ago may no longer be considered engaged now. When you are scoring characteristics of your target market that are unlikely to change, having points expire "never" is probably fine.
10. When you've added and configured the rules of your score, **click the "Active" button** to activate the score.

Note that the score will need to be active before you can use it for dynamic scoring with automations.

## How to adjust repeating point values (dynamic scoring)

Dynamic contact scores are created with automations that are set to run multiple times. Creating a dynamic contact score will allow you to add or subtract points each time a specific behavior occurs.

You can also set a contact score to a specific value, or reset the score to 0. You will want to make sure that you already have a contact score rule set up in order to create this automation.

To adjust points each time a behavior occurs you need to create an automation that runs multiple times.

1. **Click Automations** on the left menu.
2. **Click "New Automation."**
3. **Click "Start from scratch."**
4. **Click "Add a start trigger" > select the trigger you want to use** to adjust the score.
5. **Select the "Score" and "Changes to be" options** from the dropdowns.
6. Change the “Runs” setting of the trigger to “Multiple Times” by **clicking the "Runs" dropdown** and **selecting “Multiple Times.”** This is an important setting because it is what allows the automation to distribute points over and over each time a campaign is opened.
7. **Click "Save."**
8. The "Add new action" modal will appear. Here you can add an action that will adjust the score. **Click "Contacts"** then **click "Adjust score."**
   * **Use the dropdowns to select the score you wish to adjust** and if you want to add, reduce or set a specific value for the contact score when a contact encounters this step in your automation
   * **Type the number of points** in the field provided
   * **Use the "Expires" setting to define when the points should drop off the score**. If you are scoring on engagement, you might want the points to drop off after a month or two so that the score always indicates your recently engaged contacts
   * **Click "Save"**
9. **Type the name of the automation** into the field provided, and **click "Active"** to turn the automation on.

**Examples of automation triggers you can use to adjust a contact score**

* You can remove points when a contact unsubscribes from a list using the “Unsubscribes” trigger
* You can give points each time they open an email campaign using “Open/reads an email”
* You can distribute more points when they open a specific, important campaign using the “Opens/reads an email” trigger
* You can distribute points each time a web page is visited using the “Web page is visited” trigger
* You can add points when an event happens using the “Event is recorded” trigger
* You can add points when a contact forwards your email campaign to another person using the “Forwards and email” trigger
* You can add points when they submit a form with specific selections using the “Field changes” trigger
* You can add points when they click specific links in an email campaign using the “Clicks a link in email” trigger

## Beginning automations based on scores

You might want automations to begin when contacts reach a certain score. For instance, you could create an automation that automatically creates a deal record, assigns the deal, and creates a task to reach out to the primary contact when a contact reaches a score of 75 points or more. You can do this with the “Score changes” trigger.

1. From the Automations overview page, **click "New Automation."**
2. **Click the "Start from Scratch" option,** then **click "Continue."**
3. **Click the "Score Changes" trigger,** then **click "Continue."**
4. Using the dropdowns, **select which score should trigger the automation** and set whether the automation should run once or multiple times. Then **click "Add start."**

This feature is available for the following plan types: 
Starter, Plus, Pro, Enterprise

With ActiveCampaign, you can send direct 1:1 emails, or one-off messages, from the Contact Overview page and a contact record.

## Take note

* Contacts do not need to be subscribed to a list to receive a direct 1:1 email
* 1:1 emails do not contain an unsubscribe link
* If you are on a Plus, Professional, or Enterprise plan, you can also send a direct 1:1 email from a [Deal record](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001093870), an [Account record](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/9830097566236), or [Automation](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/4416094276252)
* Engagement with 1:1 emails sent from the contact record will not be reflected in segments or  segment builders

## About sending direct 1:1 emails from a contact record

There are two ways you can send direct 1:1 emails from a contact record:

1. From your ActiveCampaign account (*Available on all plans*)
2. From a [connected email account](/hc/en-us/articles/218253748) (*Sales Plus, Professional, and Enterprise*)

**From your ActiveCampaign account**

*Available on all plans.*

Sending from your ActiveCampaign account does not require any setup and is available in your account at any time. These direct 1:1 emails will be sent from ActiveCampaign ‘s servers and have the following benefits:

* View the sent email on the "Emails" tab on the contact record
* View the sent email on the "Emails" tab on the deal record
* The "From" email address used in your 1:1 emails is the email address associated with the account user and cannot be changed
* View the sent email on the contact's activity stream
* Email opens activity will appear in the contact’s activity stream
* Email opens activity can be used with the “Opens/Reads an email” automation trigger
* Email link clicks and email replies will not appear in the contact’s activity stream
* It is not possible to use the “Clicks a link in an email” or “Replies to an email” automation triggers with this feature

**From a connected email account to ActiveCampaign**

*Available on Sales Plus, Professional, and Enterprise.*

If you choose to [connect your email account to ActiveCampaign](/hc/en-us/articles/218253748), it will use your email account to send the email and not ActiveCampaign’s servers. This option has additional benefits and also lets you:

* Use a Cc or a Bcc
* Track opens, link click, and reply activity
* Trigger automations based on engagement activity (opens, clicks, replies)
* View the sent email on the contact's activity stream
* View the sent email on the "Emails" tab on the contact record
* View the sent email on the "Emails" tab on the deal record
* View email engagement activity on the contact's activity stream
* View your sent emails in the Sent folder of your email inbox
* Sync follow-up email correspondence to your ActiveCampaign account

Learn [how to connect your email to ActiveCampaign](/hc/en-us/articles/218253748).

You cannot send direct1:1 emails with both sending options at the same time. Once you connect your email account to ActiveCampaign in Deals > Connected Emails, you cannot send direct 1:1 emails from the ActiveCampaign servers. You would need to disconnect the connected email to use the ActiveCampaign servers.

![Three dot icon to switch to or from HTML or Plain Text.jpg](/hc/article_attachments/20317133436444)

You cannot choose a font or font in 1:1 emails.

## Include a Saved Response in your email

Saved Responses is a time-saving solution that lets you create and reuse commonly used phrases in your 1:1 emails. You can learn more about them by visiting the ["About Saved Responses" help article](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001103424).

Saved Responses can only be used with 1:1 emails.

To use a saved response in your email:

1. **Click the “Saved Responses” icon.  
   ![Saved Responses Icon.jpg](/hc/article_attachments/20317133439900)**
2. Then **click the response** you want to use.

## Use personalization in your 1:1 emails

You can add personalization to your email with personalization tags with two options:

Option 1:

1. **Click the "Personalize" icon**.  
   ![Personalize Icon.jpg](/hc/article_attachments/20317144289308)
2. **Choose the Personalization Attribute** from the list and a blue placeholder will show up where your cursor is in the email composer.

Option 2:

1. **Type the percentage symbol (%)** into the body of the message. You’ll be presented with "Attribute Menu" of fields you can insert.
2. **Select the field** you wish to use, you’ll see a blue placeholder in the email composer with an inserted value.

Note: If any of the personalization tags appear in red, then the contact does not have a value for that field. If you try to send a personal email with a tag highlighted in red, you will be asked to add a value for that field before sending your message.

## Use AI in your 1:1 emails

*Available with [connected emails](/hc/en-us/articles/218253748) only.*

You can use AI in 1:1 emails to help write and enhance your message.

To use this option:

1. From your 1:1 email, **click the AI icon** at the bottom right.  
   ![AI Icon.jpg](/hc/article_attachments/20317133440156)
2. In the modal, **provide a prompt**. For example, you can type “A thank you for following up and telling them I’ll reach out to them.” The more specific you can be, the better the results you’ll receive.
3. **Click the “Submit” button**.
4. **Click the green check mark** to add the suggested text to your 1:1 email, or **click the red “X”** to discard the suggested text.
5. If the suggestion is not right:
   * **Click the circle arrow icon** to retry
   * **Click into the “Ask AI to change it” field** and choose to make the text longer, shorter, or change the tone. You can also type more specific feedback, like “Make it funny,” into the space provided.

This feature is available for the following plan types: 
undefined

Pipelines & Sales Engagement add-ons
Included with Enterprise.
To purchase either add-on, you must have a Plus or Professional plan.

You can send direct 1:1 emails to a contact on an account right from their account record. You can use this feature to set up a meeting or schedule a follow-up call with the contact.

If you are looking to automate your 1:1 email, learn [how to send an automated 1:1 email](/hc/en-us/articles/4416094276252).

## Take note

* Contacts do not need to be subscribed to a list to receive a direct 1:1 email
* Direct 1:1 emails do not contain an unsubscribe link
* You can also send 1:1 email from the [Contacts Overview page or a Contact Record](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001103144), [Deal record](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001093870), or an [automation](/hc/en-us/articles/4416094276252)

## About sending direct 1:1 emails from an account record

There are two ways to send direct 1:1 emails in ActiveCampaign:

**From an email connected to ActiveCampaign**

If you [connect your email account to ActiveCampaign in Deals > Connected Emails](/hc/en-us/articles/218253748), you can use it to send direct 1:1 emails to contacts right from your account. When you do, it will use your email account to send the email and not ActiveCampaign's servers. This also lets you:

* Use a Cc or a Bcc
* Track opens, link click, and reply activity
* Trigger automations based on engagement activity (opens, clicks, replies)
* View the sent email on the contact's activity stream
* View the sent email on the "Emails" tab on the contact record
* View the sent email on the "Emails" tab on the account record
* View email engagement activity on the contact's activity stream
* View your sent emails in the Sent folder of your email inbox
* Sync follow-up email correspondence to your ActiveCampaign account

Learn [how to connect your email account to ActiveCampaign](/hc/en-us/articles/218253748).

**From your ActiveCampaign account**

If you haven't connected your email account to ActiveCampaign in Deals > Connected Emails, you can still send direct 1:1 emails to contacts using the instructions below. However, these will be sent from ActiveCampaign's servers instead of your email account. This sending option has limited benefits, all of which are listed below:

* View the sent email on the contact's activity stream
* View the sent email on the "Emails" tab on the contact record
* View the sent email on the "Emails" tab on the account record

You cannot send direct 1:1 emails with both sending options at the same time. Once you connect your email account to ActiveCampaign in Deals > Connected Emails, you cannot send direct 1:1 emails from the ActiveCampaign servers. You would need to disconnect the connected email to use the ActiveCampaign servers.

## Send a 1:1 email from an account record

1. **Click Contacts > Accounts** to navigate to the Accounts page.
2. Locate the account, then **click the account name** to open the account record.
3. **Open the email composer**. To do so, you can take any one of the following three actions:  
   * **Click the "Send an email" button** at the top right
   * Go to the Contacts section of the account record and **click the email address of the contact** you wish to send an email to
   * In the Contacts section of the account record, **click “Send an email”**
   * **Click the "Emails" tab** at the bottom of the account record and **click "Send an email"**
4. The email composer will load. **Set the "To" email address**. This is the email address of the contact who will receive your email. Note that the recipient must be a contact associated with the account. You can only select one contact.
5. The "From" email address is set for you by default and will show your connected email address. You can switch the "From" email address to any email address you have [connected to ActiveCampaign](/hc/en-us/articles/218253748).
   * If your email account is not connected, we'll show your ActiveCampaign account email address here  
       

     You cannot send direct 1:1 emails with both sending options at the same time. Once you connect your email account to ActiveCampaign in Deals > Connected Emails, you cannot send direct 1:1 emails from the ActiveCampaign servers. You would need to disconnect the connected email to use the ActiveCampaign servers.
6. Optional: Set a Cc and or a Bcc (connected email accounts only). To set up this option:  
   * **Click either Cc or Bcc**
   * **Type the email address** into the field provided
7. **Type the subject line** into the subject line field.
8. **Type the message** into the message field.
9. While creating your message, you can also:

   * [Automate your 1:1 email](#h_01H7B97PQFBGAJ0RTDVFNZMN2Y)
10. When finished, **click the "Send" button** to send the email to your contact.

Note: If any of the personalization tags appear in red, then the contact does not have a value for that field. If you try to send a personal email with a tag highlighted in red, you will be asked to add a value for that field before sending your message.

## Use AI in your 1:1 emails

*Available with [connected emails](/hc/en-us/articles/218253748) only.*

You can use AI in 1:1 emails to help write and enhance your message.

To use this option:

This feature is available for the following plan types:

Pipelines & Sales Engagement add-ons

To purchase either add-on, you must have a Plus, Professional, or Enterprise plan.

A deal score is one of two types of lead scores that you can create in your ActiveCampaign account. It is used to evaluate and prioritize the quality of your deals.

## What is a deal score?

A deal score is a numerical value assigned to your deals—the higher the score, the better the deal.

A single score can be comprised of one or more rules that can award or subtract points from a deal if conditions are met. For example, you can have a deal score rule that assigns 10 points if a deal is in the "In Contact With" stage and another deal score rule that adds 10 points if the lead has a certain household income level. A deal that matches both of those rules would be awarded 20 points.

Scores are created on the Manage Scoring page, and rules for your scores are made using any information in the [segment builder](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/221483407). In addition, these scores can be set to expire after a period of time. There is no limit to the number of scores you can create in your account.

Scores can run once per deal regardless of how many times it matches your rules. This is called "Static Scoring*."* Scores can also run each time a deal matches your rules. This is called "Dynamic Scoring" and is accomplished with an automation set to run multiple times.

## Uses for Deal Scoring

Deal scoring can help your sales team focus on closing the highest-value deals and see which deals have less of a chance of closing. You can use this feature to:

* **Profile leads as they move through your pipeline**You can give any lead who enters your pipeline a deal score of 100 points, then set a rule to deduct points from that score if they are not progressing quickly enough through your stages. For instance, if you haven't heard from a lead in over 14 days, you can deduct points for every two days that your lead has not progressed. The fewer points your deal has, the less chance your sales team has of closing it. This will allow your team to focus on other high-value deals.
* **Find high-value leads by summarizing lead scores**You can create a deal score that summarizes different lead scores to identify high-value leads in your pipeline. For instance, you may want to make a deal score for a contact who engaged with your communications, who lives in a specific geographical area, and who submitted an application on your site. You can create a deal score that summarizes that information for that lead.
* **Find high-value leads based on actions**Let's say that you have an automation and know that you have a 75% chance of closing a deal with a lead if they enter that particular automation. You can create a deal score for any lead that enters that automation and notify your sales team.
* **Search for deals by deal score by using a filter**Searching deals by deal score makes it easy for your team to view high-value deals at a glance. To search for deals by deal score:
  1. **Click Deals** on the left menu**.**
  2. **Click** "**Add Filter**," then **click** "**Deal Details."**
  3. **Click the name of the deal score** by which to filter.
* **Sort deals by score in a specific stage**Sorting deals by a deal score in a stage lets you view deals in ascending or descending order in that specific stage. To sort deals by a score in a particular stage:
  1. **Click the gear icon** for the stage you wish to sort.
  2. **Click "Edit Stage."**
  3. **Use the "Deal Sorting" dropdowns** to sort your deals by deal score.

## How to create a static deal score

Static deal scores are created with rules under Manage Scoring on the Contacts Overview page. These will only be applied once to a deal, regardless of how many times a deal matches your rules.

If you wish to add or subtract points each time a deal matches your rules, you will need to use an automation triggered to run multiple times and an "Adjust Score" action.

To create a static deal score:

1. **Click Contacts > Scoring** on the left menu.
2. **Click the "Add a Score" button**.
3. **Click "Deal Score**."
4. **Click "Add New Rule**."
5. **Use the segment builder to create your rule**. You can give your rule a title and a short description on this page.
6. When finished creating your rule, **click "Active"** at the top right and then **click "Save."**

## How to add or subtract repeating point values (dynamic scoring)

Dynamic deal scores are created with automations that are set to run multiple times.

Creating a dynamic deal score lets you add or subtract points each time a specific behavior occurs. You can also set a deal score to a particular value or reset the score to 0. You'll want to ensure that you already have a deal score rule to create this automation.

In the following scenario, we will create a rule that will add 5 points to a deal score every time a lead replies to a 1:1 email. You will need to connect your email account to Deals to use this option.

1. From the Automations Overview page, **click "New Automation**."
2. **Click "Start from scratch**," then **click "Continue."**
3. A modal window will appear with various triggering conditions to start this automation. **Click the "Replies to an email trigger"** then **click "Continue**."
4. An "Action Options" modal will open. **Click the "When a contact replies to a personal email" option.**
5. Next, **change the "Runs" setting to "Multiple Times."** This is an important setting because it allows the automation to distribute points repeatedly each time a campaign is opened.
6. **Click** "**Add Start**."
7. The "Add new action" modal will appear. Here you can add an action that will adjust the score. **Click "CRM,"** then **click "Adjust score."**
8. In the modal window, use the dropdowns to:
   * **Select the score** you wish to adjust
   * **If you want to add, reduce, or set a specific value** to a deal score when the lead encounters this action in your automation
   * **Type the number of points**
9. **Use the "Expires" setting** to define when the points should drop off the score.
10. **Select which deal** will be affected and **select a pipeline**.
11. **Click "Save**."
12. **Type the name of the automation** into the field provided and **click "Active"** to turn on the automation.

Additional examples of triggers you can use to adjust a deal score:

* You can add points when a lead enters a pipeline using the "Enters a pipeline" trigger
* You can add or subtract points when a deal stage changes using the "Deal stage changes" trigger
* You can add points if a lead replies to an email using the "Replies to an email" trigger
* You can add points if a lead completes an event through the "Event is recorded" trigger

## Beginning automations based on deal scores

You can trigger automations when a lead or contact reaches a specific deal score. For instance, you could create an automation that will notify your sales team to follow up with a lead once their deal reaches that score.

1. From the Automations Overview page, **click "New Automation**."
2. **Click the "Start from Scratch"** **option**, then **click "Continue."**
3. **Click the "Score Changes" trigger**, then **click** "**Continue."**
4. **Use the dropdowns** to select the score that should trigger the automation, then **set the automation to run once or multiple times.**
5. Then click "**Add start."**

This feature is available for the following plan types:

Sales engagement enhanced CRM add-on

To purchase this add-on, you must have a Plus, Professional, or Enterprise plan.

Win Probability is a percentage field on each deal that signifies how likely that deal is to be won. This allows you and your sales team to prioritize deals so you can focus your time and efforts on those that matter most to your business.

## How Win Probability works

Each deal with an *Open* status will display the Win Probability percentage in the "Deal Info" box:

![Win_probability_percentage.png](/hc/article_attachments/20316643107356)

Deals with a *Won* or *Lost* status will not have a Win Probability calculation in the "Win Probability" field. Instead, this field will say *Not yet calculated*.

This percentage is calculated from factors that correlate with deals marked as *Won* in a pipeline. Each set of factors is specific and unique to each pipeline; each pipeline will have its own set of factors. These factors can range anywhere from the number of tasks created to whether or not a deal entered a specific stage in your pipeline to a contact's email domain.

For our system to accurately calculate the Win Probability value for an open deal, you must already have the following data requirements in place:

* [Correctly mark closed deals as *Won*or*Lost*](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000240450)
* Have at least 100-150 deals in a pipeline marked as Won and some deals marked as Lost
* Have a healthy distribution of Won and Lost deals

If you do not have 100-150 deals correctly marked as *Won* in a pipeline, you will see a *Not yet calculated* message instead of a percentage.

In addition, updating several old deals to *Won* or *Lost* at once will not help calculate accurate Win Probability values. These values are based on when a deal was opened and marked as either Won or Lost. Closing several past deals at once will create inaccurate Win Probability data.

If the Win Probability value for a deal is between 6% and 94%, we'll display the exact value in the "Deal Info" box.

A Win Probability value less than or equal to 5% will be displayed as Less than 5%.

A Win Probability value greater than or equal to 95% will be displayed as Greater than 95%.

In addition, the more deals marked as *Won* or *Lost* in your pipeline, the more data we have to work with to accurately calculate the Win Probability value for each deal.

The model updates weekly on Saturdays.

**Things to note:**

* Deals marked as *Won* or *Lost* will no longer impact Win Probability calculations for that pipeline and will have a Win Probability value of *Not yet calculated*
* Deals marked as *Won* or *Lost* and then re-opened will no longer inform Win Probability calculations for that pipeline. However, they can still display a Win Probability value
* Deals moved to a different pipeline are unusable from a data collection standpoint. You can move a deal to any pipeline you like, which may display a Win Probability value based on the new pipeline's criteria. However, this value may be inaccurate, and the system will no longer learn anything from what happens inside this deal
* It is recommended to create a new deal instead of re-opening deals marked as *Won* or *Lost*. A closed deal that is re-opened can display a Win Probability value. However, it will no longer inform Win Probability calculations

## How to access Win Probability settings

Each pipeline in your account will have Win Probability configuration settings. By default, these settings will be turned on. You can make any minor adjustments to these settings as you see fit. However, it's important to note that **any changes you make to these settings *will* impact Win Probability calculations**.

To access the Win Probability settings for your pipeline(s), **click Deals > Deal Settings** on the left menu.

The "Win Probability" box will be displayed toward the bottom of the page.

![Win Probability in Deals > Deal Settings.jpg](/hc/article_attachments/20316657759388)

Each tab in this box is a pipeline in your account, and they will have their configuration settings. Again, these configuration options calculate the Win Probability value for deals in individual pipelines.

## Data Start Date: Win Probability Settings

The "Data Start Date" is the first configuration setting listed for each pipeline. This is the **date we start collecting deal-specific data from your account**.

The information collected from that date forward calculates Win Probability values for deals in that specific pipeline. Any deal data from before this date will not be used in these calculations.

The default value for this field is the date the pipeline was created. However, you can change this date by **clicking into the date field** and **selecting a new date** in the calendar:

![Data_start_date.gif](/hc/article_attachments/20316643108252)

**Click "Reset"** to reset the date to your pipeline's creation date.

![Reset_to_default_option.png](/hc/article_attachments/20316657759644)

The calendar will only allow you to go back as early as the pipeline was created.

**Note**: After changing the "Data Start Date," there may be up to a 30-minute delay before new calculations are made.

## Sales Cycle Length: Win Probability Settings

The Sales Cycle length is the **longest time** it takes for you and your team to mark deals as Won or Lost. We use this information to understand your sales cycle better, so we can best calculate accurate Win Probability values for your deals.

The default amount of time is set to 20 days. However, you can change this to any amount of time that better fits your sales cycle.

To update the amount of time, **type in a new number** and **select Days, Weeks, Months, or Years** from the dropdown:

![sales_length_cycle.png](/hc/article_attachments/20316643108636)

If you're unsure what to put here, consult your sales team and give an honest estimate for the longest time it takes to mark a deal as *Won* or *Lost*.

You may lose valuable data if the Sales Cycle Length is too short.

Open deals that last longer than the sales cycle value will be considered *Lost* when used in Win Probability calculations, even if they aren't marked as Lost in the CRM.

These deals will NOT be marked as *Lost* by this feature.

**Note**: After updating the Sales Cycle length, there may be a 30-minute delay before new calculations are made.

## Win Probability Factors: Win Probability Settings

The Win Probability Factors is a curated list of items used to calculate Win Probability for deals in a specific pipeline. While there are over 100 factors used to calculate this percentage, only 20 of the most relevant ones are shown—these factors affect Win Probability calculations the most.

![Win_probability_factors.png](/hc/article_attachments/20316657760156)

**Note**: Win Probability Factors may vary from pipeline to pipeline. In addition, these factors may change over time as the feature learns more about your sales processes.

By default, these factors are turned On. However, if you know that the factor is irrelevant to your business, you can quickly turn it Off. To do so, **click the On toggle** to change it to Off.

**Note**: Once a factor is turned off, it will not be used to calculate the Win Probability for deals in that pipeline. In addition, there may be up to an hour delay before that condition is used in calculations.

## Create segments using Win Probability values

Win Probability can be used in segment conditions. You can use this to locate deals with a specific Win Probability value or whose Win Probability falls within a particular range.

From the segment builder, **go to Deal Details > Has deal with Win Probability**, and **use the dropdowns** to define your desired segment.

You can segment by the following operators:

* Is
* Is not
* Greater than
* Greater than or equal to
* Less than
* Less than or equal to

This allows you to create targeted segments based on particular parameters of Win Probability.

This feature is available for the following plan types: 
Starter, Plus, Pro, Enterprise

With link tracking, you can see if contacts clicked any links in your campaigns. This helps you gauge the effectiveness of your emails and measure contact engagement.

## How link tracking works

By default, link tracking is enabled for all direct and automated campaigns that include links.

We add a unique tracking link to every link you include in your campaign. The tracking link is specific to the campaign you send and each contact who receives it.

When a contact clicks a link in your campaign, they are directed to the URL you specified. We then use a tracking link to log that link click action in our system. This link click action is reflected in your campaign reports and each contact's record, under the recent activity stream.

Note that we cannot track a link click action that uses an email address or a [personalization tag](/hc/en-us/articles/220709307) in place of a URL.

With link tracking, you can see the following data in your campaign reports:

* Which links are being clicked
* The number of times those links are clicked
* Which contacts clicked links

In addition to tracking engagement with your emails, you can use link tracking to trigger [link actions](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001303070--Video-Link-actions) and [automations](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/218788687), create [segments](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/221483407), add [conditional content](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/220358207) to your campaigns, update a lead score, and more.

## Link tracking and Site Tracking

If you're using the [Site Tracking feature](/hc/en-us/articles/221542267), we'll add a parameter to each link in your email that directs contacts to a page on your site with Site Tracking installed. We add some information to the link in a way that lets us identify the contact who clicked your campaign link and visited your web page. This additional link information should not be visible to the end user.

We add this information to these URLs because it lets us send the contact's information to your webpage so we can track and log their page visit. It also keeps us compliant with major web browsers on how we collect data on contacts and their page visit activity.

If you wish to remove this parameter, you can take one of two actions:

**Option 1: Manually turn off link tracking for each email you create**  
This is done on the Campaign Summary page for each campaign under "Options." When link tracking is turned off, we will not be able to track any link click engagement with your emails.

**Option 2: Untick the "Site Tracking" box for the whitelisted URL.**

This will turn off site tracking for that URL. This is done on the Settings>Tracking page in your account.

## How link tracking works with custom domain names (CNAMEs)

If you use a custom domain name ([CNAME](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/207331210-How-do-I-use-a-custom-domain-name-CNAME-)) and have link tracking enabled, we’ll still redirect contacts to one of our link tracking domains to track that link click. These domains will be masked with your CNAME.

## View link click data

Link click data is located on the reports page for each direct and automated campaign you send.

**Locate link click data for direct campaigns**

1. **Click Reports** on the left menu.
2. **Click the "All Campaigns" option** on the left side of your screen.
3. **Click the campaign name**.
4. **Click the "Clicks" option** located in the "Summary" box.

**Locate link click data for automated campaigns**

1. **Click Reports** on the left menu.
2. **Click the "Automation Reports" option** on the left side of your screen.
3. **Click "All Automations."**
4. Locate the automation for which you want to view link click data. Then **click the ellipsis** that appears under the automation name.
5. A modal window will appear. **Click the "Automation Overview" option**.
6. **Scroll down** the report until you see the Campaign Metrics table. **Click the ellipsis** under the campaign's name, then **click the "Campaign Overview" option**.
7. **Click the "Clicks" option** located in the "Summary" box.

## Information in the Clicks report

The Clicks report contains the following data:

* **Clicks**  
  Number of unique contacts that clicked on any link in a campaign. This metric includes only one click per contact.
* **Total link clicks**  
  Total number of times each link was clicked. This metric includes duplicate link clicks for each contact.
* **Unique link clicks**  
  Total unique clicks per link. This metric will not count duplicate link clicks per contact.
* **Did Not Click Any Links**  
  Number of contacts that did not click on any link.
* **Avg. Recipients Per Link Click**  
  Percentage shows the average link clicks per contact. It is calculated from the total number of link clicks divided by the number of contacts that clicked at least one link.

Also, we'll show you how each link performed in your email. You can **click any link** in the report to view a list of contacts who clicked that link.

URL tracking is based on unique URLs being used and not hyperlinked text. To see the performance of each link, ensure that the URLs differ by at least one parameter so they can be tracked separately.

## Link tracking and plain text campaigns

While it is possible to track link clicks in plain text campaigns, it is not advised for the following reasons:

* It is not possible to embed your URL into text
* Not all email clients or devices will hyperlink your URL when the email is received by your contact, making the link "not clickable." This can result in your contact copying and pasting your URL into a browser, which will not be tracked as a link click

If you wish to send a text-only email to contacts and track link clicks and opens, you can do so by creating an email that uses any template available in the template library and deleting all image blocks.

## If a contact has images disabled, will their link click be tracked?

Yes, we will still track that link click. In addition, that link click will also be counted as a campaign open.

Spam check is a tool that you can use to help identify areas of "spamminess" in your campaigns and automation emails prior to sending them out to your contacts.

While a high score doesn’t necessarily mean your email is spam (just like a low score does not guarantee inbox placement), Spam Check is a great tool to get insights in order to improve your mailing.

## What is Spam Check?

We run a Spam Check for every campaign and automation email you create. The Spam Check tool scans the content of your message and displays your results on both the Campaign Summary page and Campaign Settings page. The backend tool at work for Spam Check is called SpamAssassin. This is the most widely used open-source tool for scanning messages for “spamminess.”

If Spam Check did not see any issues with your content, you will see “Passed” with a green checkmark. If Spam Check did come across any issues with your content, you’ll be presented with a number score as well as a list of issues you may want to fix. The list of issues presented triggered at least one rule for “spamminess.”

## A few important notes about Spam Check

* Spam Check (SpamAssassin) does not prevent you from sending your email. It’s simply pointing out issues you may want to fix before sending the communication out to your contacts
* Spam Check (SpamAssassin) only scans the content of your message. It does not know anything about the reputation of your domain or the makeup of your list. You can pass the Spam Check and still experience deliverability issues
* SpamAssassin can be customized and expanded in many ways: ISPs can add, remove or change rules
* Spam Check will only show you data for a “default” configuration
* Major ISPs do not rely heavily on SpamAssassin when identifying spam (Gmail, Hotmail/Outlook/Microsoft, Yahoo/AOL/Oath), and many do not use SpamAssassin at all. These providers may leverage some of the same logic that’s represented in SpamAssassin, but their anti-spam systems are proprietary and far more complex

## How concerned should you be if you did not pass the Spam Check?

Not very concerned. In fact, [SpamAssassin says on their wiki](https://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/AvoidingFpsForSenders):

> Tip: Don't worry too much about specific rules within SpamAssassin. The rules catch spam. If your email isn't spam, you shouldn't be matching the rules. Even if you do hit an occasional rule, unless your email actually is spam, it shouldn't score high enough to be a problem.

In other words, if you’re following best practices, such as keeping a clean list and sending engaging content only to people who genuinely opted in, then you shouldn’t have to worry about occasionally getting a few points in the Spam Check. These rules are suggestions to help point you in the right direction; they are not indicators of success or failure.

SpamAssassin also advises you to “Use normal conversational language.” In other words, don’t try anything fancy. If you use common sense when sending an email, you shouldn’t be triggering any Spam rules with ISPs.

Read the ["Deliverability tips for content" help article](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001303224) for more general tips and best practices about email content regarding deliverability.

## Common Spam Check Errors

Below is a list of the most common Spam Check errors our customers see, and what you can do to fix them.

Not finding what you are looking for in the table below? Other online resources provide a more [comprehensive list of SpamAssassin Rules](https://topdeliverability.com/spamassassin-rules/).

| Error | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Refers to a muscle relaxant | Look for the phrases soma, cycl (cyclobenzaprine), flexeril, skelaxin, or zanaflex. |
| Sender email is commonly abused end user mail provider | Do not use a Freemail from address like @gmail, @yahoo. You’ll want to use your own From email address. |
| No Description Available | Look for phrases:   * “gold dust” * "Your...account" * “Dr.” * "your compensation"   And check to make sure the From Address of your email isn’t a freemail provider like @gmail.com, @yahoo.com or @yahoo.com. |
| BODY: No description available | Look for the phrase "Reply to this email..." |
| BODY: HTML has a low ratio of text to image area | Ignore |
| BODY: Message is 10% to 20% HTML obfuscation BODY: Message is 20% to 30% HTML obfuscation | Balance images and text ratio. Problem is likely that the content has too many images and very little text. Sometimes this is a false positive, due to the complex mobile responsive code generated by the email designer page. |
| URI: Uses %-escapes inside a URL's hostname | This can happen if you are using a personalization tag like %EMAIL%, which SpamAssassin will sometimes flag. You can ignore this because this will be populated at send time. |
| Make lots of money! | Remove the word "lucrative" or "profitable" from email text. |
| You use too many tags in your code | This is usually a false positive. SpamAssassin is seeing the complex code from our email designer and thinking that it's obscuring content. |
| Subject has exclamation mark and question mark | Remove '!' and/or '?' from subject lines. |
| BODY: Removal phrase right before a link | Remove the word 'Here" in 'Unsubscribe Here' at the footer of the email. |
| Subject contains "Your Family" | Don't use the phrase "your family." |
| Accessing a blocklisted\* URL or obscuring source of | Usually this happens with custom HTML. Look at the source of your URLs for your images. Most likely you copy/pasted a cached image from Gmail that is sourced from googleusercontent.com, which is very spammy. Instead upload the JPG/PNG to ActiveCampaign and insert it into their campaigns via the image manager, or host the image at your own domain. |
| Your message contains characteristics similar to those used by scammers | Remove the phrase "your compensation." |
| A URI hostname has a long a (6 characters or more) hexadecimal sequence. This looks suspicious | Check links for long number sequences like some abnormally formatted phone numbers. This can also happen if your account name has a long string of numbers like 1857105312.activehosted.com. Our Customer Experience Team can help you [rename the account](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001053170) if this is the case. |
| Your message claims to be a "marketing partner" of the recipient. This is often filtered as spam. | Remove the phrase "marketing partner" or "network partner." |
| RAW: Message contains Dear but with no name | You opened your message with Dear but no actual first name. This might happen if you are using Dear %FIRST%, and SpamAssassin is not seeing an actual first name because the personalization tag isn’t populated yet. |
| BODY: Incorporates a tracking ID number | Look for a very long link or very long word with hyphens like Bestimmungs-Kraft-Session-2-Aufzeichnung that will trigger this rule. |
| Subject talks about losing pounds | Look for the phrase "lose pounds/lbs/weight" in the subject line. |
| UC\_GIBBERISH\_OBFU | Look for a phrase like "condizioni VANTAGGIOSISSIME quello", usually a false positive due to long words in non-English languages. |
| BODY: HTML: images with 2000-2400 bytes of words | The message is very short with just a little bit of text. |
| BODY: One Time Rip Off | Look for “one time” or “rip off” or a combination of those words within your campaign content. |

\*The term "blocklist" is also known as "blacklist." These two terms are often used interchangeably.

This feature is available for the following plan types:

Please note that what you see in your account may differ from some of the steps outlined in this article. The "Campaigns" section in your ActiveCampaign account has been updated to say "Email."

With the ActiveCampaign AI Campaign Builder, you can create an AI-generated campaign based on a single text prompt. The AI-generated campaign includes a subject line, preheader, layout, images, content, and call to action.

The AI Campaign Builder helps you create quick campaigns, including creating multiple versions for A/B testing, incorporating [brand kit](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/15020035948444) information, and providing campaign inspiration.

In this article, you’ll learn the basics of the AI Campaign Builder.

## Take note

* Set up your [AI Brand Kit](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/15020035948444) before using the AI Campaign Builder to help keep your campaigns consistent
* AI Campaign Builder is only available on the Campaigns page with the [Standard campaign type](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/220116088) using the [Email Designer](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404950771612)
* AI-generated campaigns will be tagged with the AI icons on the Campaigns Overview page

### While creating a new campaign

1. **Click Campaigns** on the left menu.
2. **Click the “Create a new campaign” button**.
3. Under the “Standard” campaign type, **click the“Create with AI” radio button**.
4. **Click “Next”** to open the AI Campaign Builder.
5. If you have multiple brand kits, **select one** from the “Brand kit” dropdown.
6. **Select a template.**
7. In the “What is this message about” field, **type in a detailed prompt** describing your desired email campaign, including subject, colors, themes, and patterns.
8. **Click the “Generate” button**.
9. **Review the AI-generated campaign preview** on the right and **edit as needed**. Learn [how to make edits to your AI-generated campaign](/hc/en-us/articles/16680546347420#h_01JC696H2WGPDHNM3EWD3GMJWF).  
     

   If you have buttons in your AI-generated campaign, you must manually insert the button links. Learn [how to insert links into the buttons in the AI Campaign Builder](/hc/en-us/articles/16680546347420#h_01JC69QXTWE6MQKT2B6AF54JE9).
10. Once you have completed editing, **click the “Next” button** to [complete the information on the Campaign Summary page and send your campaign](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/10194915935772-Create-and-send-a-campaign#h_01H90WTJPYA2T25S0NDME2RQQY).

## How to edit AI-generated campaigns

Once you create your AI-generated campaign, it can be edited from the AI Campaign Builder. After updating the options on the left, **click the “Generate” button**, and the AI will regenerate the preview on the right.

If there is any content you want to keep before regenerating the email, **hover over the content block** in your campaign layout or subject line and **click the "Lock this content" toggle** that appears. Once your email is regenerated, your locked content will remain.

It is not possible to use AI to change or edit images. However, you can swap them out manually for a different one.

When you **click the “Generate” button**, AI will completely regenerate the campaign. Previous edits will not be saved. However, AI may incorporate previous edits to the regenerated campaign's content.

You can edit your AI-generated campaign with the following options:

### Brand kit

The Brand kit option lets you incorporate your brand colors, fonts, logos, and social links. To use this option, you must set up your brand kit before using the AI Campaign Builder.  
You can **select a brand kit** from the “Brand kit” dropdown if you have multiple brand kits.

### Layout

You can choose from the following layouts in the AI Campaign Builder:

* 2 Column
* Simple
* Editorial
* Callouts
* Image grid

### Adjust AI content using feedback

You can give feedback to the AI and change the content in your AI-generated campaign by using these options:

* **“Add feedback to adjust messaging”**  
  This option lets you type specific feedback, like “Add a sense of urgency to encourage a stronger call to action,” to adjust the content in your AI-generated campaign.
* **“Quick edits”**  
  This option lets you select a quick suggestion to adjust the content in your AI-generated campaign.
* **“Base it off other content”**  
  This option pulls in content from the URL you input to use in your AI-generated campaign. This can save time and keep your messaging consistent by providing the AI with existing content.

Once you use one or all of the options above, **click the “Generate” button**. The AI will regenerate the preview on the right. The regenerated AI content will consider the original prompt, original brand kit (if you used one), and feedback provided.

Note that previous edits will not be saved exactly, but AI may incorporate the previous edits into the regenerated campaign.

You can also manually adjust the text in the preview on the right using the directions in the next section.

### Edit using the preview

You can manually adjust the text (Subject, Preheader, and body), images, and links by **clicking and editing them in the preview**.

## Links

The AI-generated campaign will not insert the link for any buttons. You must manually insert the link.

To do so:

1. **Click the button** in the preview
2. **Paste the link** into the “Insert link” field.
3. **Click “Save.”**

## Additional edits in the Email Designer

If you need to make additional layout or design changes beyond the options available in the preview in the AI Campaign Builder, you can use the full [Email Designer](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404950771612).

Once you leave the AI campaign builder page, you cannot return to edit the campaign using AI.

There are two options to get to the email designer from the AI Campaign Builder:

1. **Click “Edit in campaign designer”** at the bottom of the preview in the AI Campaign Builder.  
     
   OR
2. **Click “Next”** to get to the Campaign Summary page, then **click the “Edit design” button**.

## Edit existing emails with AI

You can edit existing emails with AI, even if they were not created with the AI campaign builder.

To do so:

1. **Open the campaign** you want to update with AI
2. **Hover over the email design** on the campaign summary page, then **click “Edit with AI.”**
3. **Use the AI edito**r to update your campaign and **click the “Regenerate” button**.

## Duplicate an email and rewrite it with a prompt

You can duplicate an existing email with AI and use prompts to edit it. To do so:

1. **Locate the email campaign** you want to edit.
2. **Click the down arrow** next to the “Continue” button.

This feature is available for the following plan types: 
Starter, Plus, Pro, Enterprise

Please note that what you see in your account may differ from some of the steps outlined in this article. The "Campaigns" section in your ActiveCampaign account has been updated to say "Email."

When you create a campaign or automation email, you can use any one of the templates we provide as a starting point. Using a template for your emails ensures brand consistency and messaging and also saves you time. They even provide guidance and best practices if you're new to email marketing. Templates make email creation easier—once you select a template all you need to do is focus on the content.

With ActiveCampaign, you can choose from a variety of [over 125 templates](https://www.activecampaign.com/email-templates) based on your business goal, a layout, or one that is predesigned. These templates include things like newsletters, feedback requests, abandoned cart notifications, and others.

You even have the option to build them using AI or you can startfrom scratch using HTML. Email templates are organized by business goals, layout, inspiration (predesigned templates), and past campaigns.

In this article, you'll learn about the types of email templates ActiveCampaign offers so you can make the right decision for your email marketing needs.

## Inspiration templates

* [Templates based on past campaigns](/hc/en-us/articles/220269607#01GJGNCJ61E77E9BBW9SESR8YY)
* [Start from scratch templates](/hc/en-us/articles/220269607#01GJGNDC8QERA54G4ZQH80SZTM)
* [Additional information on email templates](/hc/en-us/articles/220269607#01GJGNNQKFQ3RFX2721A4Z3WSF)

## Take note

* Templates are available to all ActiveCampaign plans
* Account admins have access to all templates. All other account users must be granted permission to access templates
* Templates can be accessed from [this email marketing templates page](https://www.activecampaign.com/email-templates), the Campaign Builder, and the Automation Email Builder in your ActiveCampaign account
* Once you select a template to modify, a copy of that template is created for you. Any edits you make to the copy will not affect the original
* Templates are only compatible with the designer it was created on. For example, [Email Designer](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408732634002) templates will only work with campaigns created with the Email Designer. Classic Designer or HTML templates will not work when using the Email Designer and vice versa

## AI templates

With ActiveCampaign AI Brand kit, you can import colors, fonts, and logos directly from your website to generate email templates, content, and images that are perfectly on-brand.

To create AI templates, you must create your [AI Brand kit](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/15020035948444). Once your brand kit is created, you can access your AI-generated templates here:

## Template Types

**Email Designer**

The [Email Designer](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408732634002) is ActiveCampaign’s new and improved drag-and-drop email designer launched in 2022. This designer makes it easier than ever to create branded, high-performing emails within the platform with an emphasis on reliability and easy-to-navigate UI. This email designer will give you the best possible experience to create optimal campaigns and engage your customers.

Like other templates that use the drag-and-drop designer, you can customize this template by adding, removing, or rearranging different types of content block.

**Classic Designer**

The Classic Designer is ActiveCampaign’s earlier drag-and-drop designer This simple template has a single column for copy with an image block at the top, making it mobile friendly and easy to customize.

You can also customize this template by adding, removing, or rearranging different types of content blocks.

**Custom HTML**

The HTML option gives you complete control over the design of your template. However, you must be familiar with HTML and CSS to create this kind of template. If you aren’t familiar with HTML and CSS code, but still want an appealing visual design for your email, you might want to use one of the templates described above.

Emails that use an HTML template should be previewed before sending so that you can be sure your campaign displays correctly in the most popular email clients and on mobile devices.

This feature is available for the following plan types: 
Starter, Plus, Pro, Enterprise

With ActiveCampaign’s AI Translations for Email feature, you can send personalized email campaigns in each subscriber’s language with one send. Doing so helps you drive engagement, build trust, and increase conversions across global audiences with ease.

## Take Note

* AI Translations for Email supports 75 languages
* You must purchase [Activities](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/18966067651612-Purchase-activities-with-a-monthly-limit) to use this feature
* Each translated campaign send uses one Activity. If you send an email campaign with AI Translations to 200 contacts, 50 of which will receive a translated version of the campaign, then it would cost 50 Activities. There is no additional charge for contacts receiving the original text language of the campaign
* We recommend generating translations after finalizing your email content. Modifying the original campaign will require you to regenerate all translations from scratch
* We strongly recommend you review each translated email for accuracy before sending it to your contacts
* AI Translations for Email is only available with the “Standard” campaign type in the [Email Designer](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404950771612-Email-Designer-overview) builder

## How AI Translations for Email works

You can turn on translations for each standard email campaign you create using the Email Designer. This option is located on the campaign summary page.

Once you enable this feature, our system will detect the preferred language of each contact in your list and generate the appropriate translation.

Once the translations are generated, you can view each language and edit the content and images. When you’re ready, you can send the campaign to your subscribers.

**How do we check for a preferred language?**

We check the language selected in the “Preferred Language” field for each contact. **This field is automatically created for new accounts purchased on or after June 24, 2025, and Resold accounts created on or after November 19, 2025.**

For accounts purchased before June 24, 2025 (Resold accounts created before November 19, 2025), you need to create a “Preferred Language” custom field. To do so:

1. **Click Contacts > Fields** on the left menu.
2. **Click the “Add Field” button.**
3. A modal window will appear:
   * **Type “Preferred Language”** as the field name
   * **Select the field group**
   * **Select “Language”** as the field type
   * **Click the “Add” button**

If you already have a field that tracks a contact’s preferred language, you need to map it to the newly created “Preferred Language” field. Note that your existing language field must be in a dropdown field format to map successfully.

To map your existing field to your newly created “Preferred Language” field:

1. From the Manage Fields page in your account, **click the pencil icon** (Edit) for the “Preferred Language” field.
2. **Click the checkbox** for “Automatically map values from an existing field.”
3. **Select the field** you want to map to.
4. **Click the “Next” button.**
5. If prompted, **map any new values**. These dropdowns appear as red.
6. **Click “Review all mapped values”** to view all field values being mapped.
7. When finished, **click the “Save” button.**

Once mapped, the new Language field will stay linked to the original field, allowing it to be used without interruption.

If the contact does not have a preferred language set, they are sent the default version of the campaign.

**Reporting**

You can view reporting as a single campaign as well, including breakdowns of how each translated version performed.

## Translate your standard campaign using AI

1. [**Create a Standard campaign**](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/10194915935772-Create-and-send-a-campaign#create-and-send-a-campaign-0-0) from the Campaigns page in your account.
2. **Supply all required information** on the Campaign Summary page. This includes subject line, From name, From email, recipients, and more.
3. **Select Email Designer** to create the campaign.
4. Select a template, use a blank canvas, or use [AI to create the email content](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/16680546347420-AI-Campaign-Builder-overview), including images.
5. **Edit the email content and design** as you see fit. When finished, click “Next.”
6. **Click the checkbox** for “Translate to a contact’s language.” Note that this option will be greyed out. This is because it is not yet enabled.
7. A modal window will appear. **Click “Translate campaign.”**

Our AI will immediately translate the email to all preferred languages. This should take a few moments, depending on the content being translated.

## Review and edit translations before sending

Once the translations are finished, you can review each translation to make and save changes. To do so:

1. **Click the “Review” button** located next to the “Translate to a contact’s language” checkbox on the Campaign Summary page.
2. A list of translations will appear on the pane on the left. **Click each translation** to review the email’s content and design.
3. If you need to change the content or images, **click the item** you want to update, **make the necessary changes**, and then **click “Save edits”** on the left pane.
4. To exit, either click **“Esc” or “Close.”**

This feature is available for the following plan types: 
Starter, Plus, Pro, Enterprise

This feature is in beta.

ActiveCampaign's Active Intelligence is a conversational tool that helps you create campaigns, build automations, and analyze insights.

The unified interface maintains context, i.e., understands what you’re working on, allowing you to:

* Create a campaign and immediately analyze similar past campaigns for optimization ideas
* Build an automation, and then ask questions about how similar automations have performed
* Review insights about underperforming content and immediately create improved versions
* Test different approaches and compare results by asking questions using everyday language. Active Intelligence will remember what you've talked about before in that specific chat

This integrated approach enables you to make data-driven decisions while streamlining your marketing workflow, from creation to analysis and optimization. This article walks you through how to use Active Intelligence.

## Take note

At this time, we do not use the data that you input into our services about your contacts or marketing content to train AI models.

## How to access Active Intelligence

Active Intelligence appears in two places in ActiveCampaign::

**ActiveCampaign homepage with Active Intelligence**

This is the page you see when you first log in to ActiveCampaign. You can return to this page at any time by clicking the ActiveCampaign logo at the top left of your screen. With Active Intelligence on the homepage, you can:

* Ask questions about your account and get answers
* Tell it what you want your campaign to do, and it will build it for you
* Get tips to make your current campaigns work better

**Active Intelligence sidebar**

![Active Intelligence Logo.jpg](/hc/article_attachments/22565590953372)

The Active Intelligence sidebar appears on the right side of your screen when you click the Active Intelligence icon from any page except the homepage. The Active Intelligence sidebar understands what you're working on and provides help in real-time by

* Showing you contact groups that might work well when you're looking at your contacts
* Suggesting what should trigger your automations and what they should do when you're building them
* Giving you helpful tips based on what you're working on, without navigating away from your workflow

**Other Active Intelligence options**

While you are in either Active Intelligence view, after you have started a chat, at the top left under the ActiveCampaign icon, you can also:

* Click the plus symbol to start a new chat
* Click the hamburger icon to see your chat history

Type "What can Active Intelligence do?" into the prompt field to show a full list of what you can do with it.

## Set up your Brand Kit

Before using Active Intelligence, you'll want to create a Brand Kit to ensure all generated content matches your brand voice and includes your company information:

1. **Click Active Intelligence** on the left-hand menu.
2. **Click the "Create a Brand Kit" button** if you haven't already.
3. **Complete your brand information** to help Active Intelligence automatically align idea cards and content with your brand.

Learn more about [Brand Kit](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/15020035948444) in ActiveCampaign.

## Create Campaigns

Active Intelligence helps you easily create marketing campaigns. Instead of writing email campaign content from scratch, you can provide a few details and let Active Intelligence generate personalized email campaigns for you.

1. **Click Active Intelligence** on the top menu.
2. From Active Intelligence, you can either:
   * **Type in a prompt to create a campaign**. For example:
     + “Write a product launch email that builds excitement with compelling benefits, addresses how it solves customer problems, and drives action with a clear call-to-action”
     + “Create a monthly newsletter email with diverse content including industry updates, company news, customer spotlight, and actionable tips that keep subscribers engaged and informed”
   * If you are in Active Intelligence workspace, **click one of the campaign-related idea cards** under the prompt field
3. Active Intelligence will create the campaign. **Review the generated campaign**.
4. Edit the campaign with the following options:
   * **Type a follow-up prompt** to edit or update the campaign; context is remembered within each chat tab
   * **Click into the campaign** to make manual adjustments from the Active Intelligence
   * **Click “Edit in campaign designer”** to make more advanced edits. This will open the campaign designer in a new tab, allowing you to click back to the Active Intelligence tab if needed
5. **Click the “Send test” button** to send a test campaign to the email associated with your ActiveCampaign user to review your campaign.

   Test emails do not require you to set up your [sending domain](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015584680).
6. When you are done creating the campaign, **click the “Review and send” button**.
7. [**Complete the information on the Campaign Summary page**](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/10194915935772-Create-and-send-a-campaign#h_01H90WTJPYA2T25S0NDME2RQQY).
8. Once you have completed the information on the Campaign Summary page, [**send your email**](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/10194915935772-Create-and-send-a-campaign#h_01H90WTJPZREXN5RMDW10CXA6T).

## Build Automations

Active Intelligence helps you easily create automations. Instead of manually setting up complex workflows, you can use simple prompts to build automation sequences that engage your customers.

1. **Click Active Intelligence** on the top menu.
2. From the Active Intelligence, you can either:
   * **Type in a prompt to create a campaign**. For example:
     + “Design a 4-email lead nurturing automation: Email 1 provides valuable industry insights, Email 2 shares customer success stories, Email 3 addresses common objections, Email 4 presents a clear offer with urgency”
     + “Create a 3-email welcome automation: Email 1 welcomes new subscribers and sets expectations, Email 2 shares the brand story and builds connection, Email 3 introduces key products/services with soft call-to-action”
     + “Create a 3-email re-engagement automation: Email 1 acknowledges the subscriber's inactivity and asks what content they'd prefer, Email 2 shares the brand's best content and value proposition, Email 3 offers a special incentive to stay subscribed or an easy unsubscribe option”
   * If you are in Active Intelligence workspace, **click one of the automation-related idea cards** under the prompt field
3. Active Intelligence will create the automation and campaigns. **Review the automation and campaign(s) created**.
4. Edit the automation and campaign(s) with the following options:
   * **Type a follow-up prompt** to edit or update the automation; context is remembered within each chat tab
   * **Click into the campaign(s)** to:
     + **Make manual adjustments** from Active Intelligence
     + To make more advanced edits, **click “Edit in campaign designer.”** This will open the campaign designer in a new tab, allowing you to click back to Active Intelligence tab if needed
5. **Click the “Send test” button** to send a test campaign to the email associated with your ActiveCampaign user.
6. Once you are satisfied with the automation and campaigns, **click the “Review and activate” button**. This will open the [Automation Canvas](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/14852948033820) in another tab, allowing you to click back to the Active Intelligence tab if needed.
7. **Review the final automation** and make adjustments as needed.
8. Once you are satisfied with the automation, **click “Activate” to enable it**.

## Analyze Performance

Active Intelligence allows you to ask questions about your campaign performance and get instant answers. Instead of navigating through multiple reports or dashboards, you can simply type questions and receive data, charts, and actionable recommendations.

1. **Click Active Intelligence** on the top menu.
2. **Ask a question**. For example:

This feature is available for the following plan types: 
undefined

Pipelines & Sales Engagement add-ons

To purchase either add-on, you must have a Plus, Professional, or Enterprise plan.

The Deal Forecast report provides an overview of your pipeline status and lets you forecast your business effectively on a daily, weekly, or monthly cycle. This report also allows you to review historical trends on your forecast accuracy based on what deals are still open and which deals have been closed.

This report relies on date information inputted by a deal owner for the Forecasted Close Date field that appears for all deals.

With this report, you will be able to:

* Set a date range to see metrics within a specific time period
* Measure forecast accuracy overall or by deal owner
* Export results to a CSV, TXT, Excel (2007 or later), JSON, HTML, or Markdown file

## How to access the Deal Forecast report

Note that account users assigned to the Admin group and/or who have permission to view Deals reports will be able to access this

[Click here to learn more about user permissions](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000090164-Setting-user-permissions).

To access the Deal Forecast report, there are two methods:

1. **Click "Reports"** in the left menu. **Click "Deals" > "Deal Forecast."**
2. **Click "Deals"**in the left menu. **Click "Deal Forecast"**under Reports.

The report will load metrics from the last 7 days.

## Filtering data in the Deal Forecast report

You can use the filters at the top of the report to view data by:

* **Pipeline**Use this dropdown to view data for all pipelines or a specific pipeline
* **Currency**This will display a dropdown of all currency types you have set up for your deals. This will not convert deal values into any currency. It is used to categorize only.
* **Deal Owner**Use this dropdown to view data for all deal owners or a specific deal owner
* **Forecasted close date** (date range)  
  These dates are based off the date a deal owner provides into the "Forecasted Close Date" field. The report will adjust the display range depending on the selected timeframe. Note that you can select future dates to project what revenue will close in the upcoming weeks/months.
* **Deal creation date** (date range)  
  This will display deals that were created within the timeframe selected.

To filter the report data, **click the dropdown** for the filter you wish to use then **click any of the options** presented in the dropdown. The report will automatically reload and will display filtered results.

## Information included in the Deal Forecast report

**Deal Forecast Stats**

The four stats listed at the top of the report display quick, top-level data within the parameters you set and rely on information inputted into the Forecasted Close Date field for your deals.

These four stats include:

* **Total Deal Count**The total number of deals that have either been marked as Won or Lost or are open with a forecasted close date.
* **Forecasted Value**This is the value of all deals with a forecasted close date.
* **Actual Value Marked Won**This is the value of all deals marked as "Won" with a forecasted close date.
* **Forecast accuracy**Shows how accurate your forecasts are overall. For example, if a deal was forecasted to close on January 4, 2020 and was marked as "Won" on January 4, 2020, that would be 100% forecast accuracy. If the deal was marked as "Won" on February 4th instead, then the forecast accuracy would be 0%.

**Clicking any of these stats** will let you export all deals that relate to that specific metric.

**Dynamic TImeframe Chart**

The Dynamic Timeframe Chart appears below the Deal Forecast Stats. It will display both the total forecasted values (purple bars) and the actual values marked as won (orange bars), side-by-side, at different time periods.

**Hovering your mouse** over any bar will display the dynamic timeframe (date-based) as well as the total value for that timeframe.

**Clicking any bar** will let you export all deals that relate to that specific bar.

**Dynamic Timeframe Table**

The Dynamic Timeframe Table appears below the Dynamic Timeframe Chart. It will display the following metrics for each deal owner:

* Actual Won Total Value
* Forecast Total Value
* Forecast Accuracy
* Actual Won Total Value
* Forecast Total Value
* Forecast Accuracy

**Clicking on any number** will let you export all deals that relate to that specific value.

**Deal Level Detail Table**

The Deal Level Detail Table lists all deals that relate to the data displayed on the report page and breaks down the information on a more granular level. You'll be able to download and export the results in this table.

The Deal Level Detail Table will include the following for each deal:

* Deal value
* Stage
* Pipeline
* Deal Owner
* Contact name
* Contact email
* Forecasted close date
* Status date changed
* Status

**Export the Deal Level Detail Table**

You can download the Deal Level Detail Table in order to share it with your team or tie it with other data outside your ActiveCampaign account in Excel.

To do so:

1. **Hover your mouse** over the Form Submission Details row. You'll see three vertical dots appear to the right.

2. **Click "Download Data."**

3. In the modal popup, **click the File Format dropdown** and select the format you wish to download the data into. You can choose from CSV, TXT, Excel (2007 or later), JSON, HTML or Markdown file.

4. **Click the "Download" button**.

The table will download to the file you selected and will be saved on your computer.

SMS add-on

To purchase this add-on, you must have a Plus, Professional, or Enterprise plan.

If you have the SMS add-on, you can draft, create, and send relevant, timely SMS messages to your contacts, helping you boost engagement and drive your business. The SMS campaign builder in ActiveCampaign lets you personalize the content, create shortened links, insert images, and schedule your messages.

## Take note

* To use the SMS editor in ActiveCampaign, you must have a registered United Kingdom (UK), United States (USA), or Australian (AU) number to send broadcast SMS messages
* You must have explicit consent to send SMS messages to your contacts, and those contacts must subscribe to an SMS list
* If you intend to send SMS messages to recipients in the USA, you are required to register for [A2P 10DLC](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405954552850-How-to-register-for-A2P-10DLC-in-ActiveCampaign)
* MMS is only supported in the USA and AU. The UK does not support sending MMS messages

## Create a broadcast SMS message

1. **Click the SMS** icon on the left menu.
2. **Click the “New Message” button**.
3. **Complete the following fields** on the right pane:
   * (Optional) [**Use AI to create a broadcast SMS message**](/hc/en-us/articles/17802695248284#h_01JNER0K9ZQT8FJM41ZXQNSCQ8)
   * **Message name** - Not visible to your contacts
   * **Sender name** - This is who you are/who the message is from
   * **Content** - Type the message you want to send. Note that you can add personalization and an image. The bottom left of the message box shows you how many characters you can use
   * **Automatically shorten and track links** - **Clicking this box** shortens URLs in your message so you can stay within your character count. In addition, this will track link clicks
   * **Attach image** - You can attach an image here. Doing so turns your SMS message into an MMS message. When clicked, the Content Manager modal opens, allowing you to upload and/or select your image. Note that you can also remove and replace the image. This option is not available if you have a registered UK number
   * **Select your list** - Contacts who opted into receiving SMS messages from you
   * **Schedule** - Send the message at a later date and time. Note that you can skip this part and click the “Send now” button at the top of the builder to send the message immediately
     + When selecting a time to send, make sure to [avoid quiet hours](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/17802669108380)

As you complete the SMS message fields, the pane to the left will display a preview of how the message will appear when sent to your contacts.

## Use AI to create a broadcast SMS message

1. **Click Campaigns > SMS** on the left menu.
2. From the SMS Campaigns page you can either:  
   * **Provide a prompt** in the field below “Generate a campaign in seconds,” then **click the “Generate a campaign button”**
   * **Click the “New message” button** or **open an existing SMS campaign**. Next, **provide a prompt** in the “What is this sms message about” field, then **click “Generate with AI”**  

     When creating a prompt, the more specific you can be, the better the results you’ll receive. For example, you can type, "A flash sale happening this Tuesday. Link flash sale code: TACOTUESDAY.”
3. If the suggestion is not what you are looking for, you can create a new prompt with the following steps:  
   * **Click “Make changes”**
   * **Provide another prompt**
   * (optional) **Select a tone** from the dropdown
   * **Click “Generate with AI”**
4. Finish creating your SMS message by **completing the required fields**.

How to show or hide AI

To show or hide the option to use AI in your SMS messages, **click SMS > Campaigns** on the left menu, then **click the “Show AI Create” toggle** to either green (on) or grey (off).

This will remove AI from the SMS Campaigns page and in the SMS Campaign Builder.

## SMS Campaign data on the SMS Overview page

Once you send an SMS campaign, the following real-time data will show to the right of the campaign on the SMS Overview page:

* Sent to #
* Delivered
* Clicks  
    

  To track click engagement, the “Automatically shorten and track links” checkbox must be enabled.

![SMS campaign embedded analytics.jpeg](/hc/article_attachments/20335454537756)

## Difference between SMS and MMS

An SMS message is a text message that contains up to 160 characters, excluding images.

An MMS message is similar to an SMS message, except it includes an image and text. It can contain up to 1600 characters. Only customers with a USA or AU number can send MMS messages. If you are in the UK and attach an image or GIF to your message, the MMS is converted to SMS with an embedded URL.

For the best MMS message delivery and quality, we recommend keeping files under 600 KB. Carriers may resize or block larger files.

The file types you can use in MMS messages are PNG, JPEG, and GIF.

#### Credit consumption

SMS:

* USA - 1 credit/160 characters
* UK - 5 credits/160 characters
* AU - 3 credits/160 characters

MMS:

* USA - 3 credits/1600 characters
* UK - N/A - converts to an SMS if the message contains a file
* AU - 21 credits/1600 characters

## Segmentation

With this feature comes two new segment conditions. These segment conditions are supported by broadcast SMS sending only.

**Has clicked on a link** - Looks for contacts who clicked a link in your broadcast SMS message. With this, you can select “SMS” as a channel, a specific or any SMS message, and a specific or any SMS link.

**Has not clicked** - Looks for contacts who did not click a link in your broadcast SMS message. With this, you can select “SMS” as a channel, a specific or any SMS message, and a specific or any SMS link.

This feature is available for the following plan types: 
Starter, Plus, Pro, Enterprise

Site Tracking is a powerful feature that connects your marketing and sales processes to your website activity. It allows ActiveCampaign to “see” and “react” in real-time as contacts visit your site and view specific categories and pages.

## How does Site Tracking work?

Site tracking shows you which pages on your website were visited by known contacts.

To use this feature, whitelist your URL on the Settings>Tracking page in your ActiveCampaign account. We then provide you with a tracking code. You need to add this code to the footer of every page on your website that you wish to track visits to. This tracking code sends page view data to your ActiveCampaign account.

Only one site tracking code is generated. If you want to track multiple sites, you should use this one site tracking code on all sites.

We do not support placing the site tracking code through third-party platforms, such as Google Tag Manager, as doing so can cause issues with tracking. The code should be placed directly on the website.

We use first-party cookies to track visits to every page on your site with ActiveCampaign site tracking code installed. A first-party cookie is a cookie that is created by the domain that the contact is visiting.

When the contact visits your site, their web browser saves data files to their computer under the website's name. This provides transparency to your contacts about where these tracking cookies came from and where their information is being stored.

First-party cookies cannot be shared or transferred from website to website. This is to protect the security of your contacts. If you have multiple websites listed in your ActiveCampaign account that use site tracking, contacts will need to be identified for each site to track their page visits.

That contact must be identified to associate page view data with them. This allows us to link page visits with their email address. Page visit data is then stored in your account. It is available on the contact's record and in the segment builder.

## How contacts are identified

There are three ways to identify contacts who visit your page.

**1. When contacts click on a link in a campaign.**

The link the contact clicks must go to a page on your website that is whitelisted and has site tracking code installed.

We add some information to the link in a way that lets us identify the contact who clicked your campaign link and visited your web page. This additional link information should not be visible to the end user.

Site tracking is not supported in [1:1 emails](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/218253798-What-is-the-difference-between-automations-campaigns-transactional-emails-and-1-1-emails#h_01HNBJVXKVDPN5366H2HQMT1NP).

**2. When they submit a form created in ActiveCampaign.**

When a contact submits your [ActiveCampaign form](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000844344), they need to [redirect to a page](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000935150) on your website that has site tracking code installed. The default "Thank you" page for ActiveCampaign forms will not generate a tracking cookie for your contacts.

Note that if the form has [double opt-in](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000853310-Double-opt-in-vs-single-opt-in) enabled, page views will not be tracked for visitors until they complete the opt-in process.

We are not able to identify visitors who submit a third-party form.

When a contact submits an ActiveCampaign form, previously anonymous site visits may be associated to their new contact record:

* The system will check site visits in the past 30 days. In some instances it could be up to a year if a contact's cookies exist
* If a contact uses different browsers, incognito mode, or clears their cookies, past site visits may not pull

**3. By dynamically inserting the email address of known visitors into the tracking code.**

If you've already identified a contact by their email address, you can insert their email address into the site tracking javascript code. See the section titled ["How to pass a contact's email address into javascript code"](#h_01G238DB1SXBGX3R42BGPHE8MP) below for more information.

Only page view data collected after the identification of the contact will be shown on their contact profile page.

Learn about [Site Tracking and the GDPR](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000872064).

## How to pass a contact's email address into javascript code

If you've already identified a contact by their email address, you can insert their email address into the site tracking javascript code. For instance, if you have a membership site, you might be able to identify them after they log in.

To do this, you will need to add the following line to the tracking code:

```
vgo('setEmail', 'Email_Address_Goes_Here');
```

above this line:

```
vgo('process');
```

If this is too technical for you, note that you do not need to use this option—you can still identify contacts with form submits and link clicks. However, if you are technical enough, this is an additional option available to you.

Once the code is on your site, and you've whitelisted your domains, ActiveCampaign will begin collecting data and adding it to your contact records as contacts are identified.

## How to set up Site Tracking

Site Tracking is quick and easy to set up. We recommend that everyone set up Site Tracking because it's a core feature that enables more powerful marketing and sales processes.

Learn how to [set up site tracking](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/221493708) with ActiveCampaign.

## How is Site Tracking different than your analytics solution?

Analytics solutions, such as Google Analytics, give you statistics about your website activity. It is aggregated data that is meant to identify trends and issues with your website.

Site Tracking, on the other hand, gives you insight into what individual contacts are doing on your site. Beyond that, and most importantly, it allows you to automatically create personalized experiences for each of your contacts as they interact with your website.

## Using Site Tracking to improve your business processes

Site Tracking allows you to create marketing and sales processes that leverage behavioral targeting, triggered messages, and granular segmentation, all of which have proven to improve the contact experience and increase conversions.

* Trigger a message with a coupon code to send 30 minutes after a contact views a product page of your site but didn't make a purchase
* Apply a tag to indicate a contact's interest and begin a targeted follow-up sequence after two or more visits to a specific product category
* Fork an automation so you treat a contact differently if they've already viewed a certain page of your site
* Trigger automations when a contact views a page on your site
* Automatically move contacts to another stage of your sales pipeline when they view 3 or more important pages of your website (such as your pricing, product, and demo pages)
* Increase or decrease a contact or lead score on the basis of visits and views of specific pages.
* Personalize the content of your campaigns based on what categories of your site a contact has repeatedly viewed with using Conditional Content

By combining Site Tracking data with other behavioral data (such as email campaign opens, link clicks, and form submits), you can identify what information and products are most important and interesting to each contact so you can target your cross-channel messages with content and offers you know appeal to them. This will increase the relevance of your messages beginning a positive feedback loop that ultimately leads to happier contacts and higher conversions.

Site Tracking connects your marketing and sales process to your website activity by tracking webpage visits made by contacts in "real-time."

## Take note

## Watch a video

## How to set up Site Tracking

Before you start, make sure to review the ["Overview of Site Tracking" help article](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/221542267) to understand how Site Tracking works and how contacts are identified.

1. **Click Website > Site Tracking** on the left menu.
2. Under Site Tracking, **click the "Enable" toggle** to set it to the "On" position.  
     
   ![Site_Tracking_Enable_Toggle.jpg](/hc/article_attachments/20315300116764)
3. **Type or paste your website URL** into the "Add Website URL" field, excluding the “http://" protocol. In addition, you are not required to include the "www" portion of the URL to whitelist a domain.
4. The "Include all website pages" option is selected by default. This means that each page on your domain will be whitelisted.  
     
   If you want to whitelist a single page or subdomain instead of all website pages with your URL, **type the specific URL** of that page into the "Add Website URL" field. Next, **uncheck the "Include all website pages" box.**
5. **Click the "Add" button**.
6. Repeat steps 4-6 for each domain and subdomain you wish to use with Site Tracking.

We'll then display your domain in the "Website URL" section of the tracking page and the "Site Tracking" box will be checked by default. This checked box means that we'll track visits made to your whitelisted URL once you install the site tracking code on your site.

You will also see that the "Conversations" box is checked by default. This means that if you're using the [Conversations](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003700720) feature, the Conversations chat widget will appear on pages that have site tracking code installed. You can always **uncheck this box** if you're not using that feature.

Conversations is no longer available for purchase to new customers as of January 3, 2023.

## How to install Site Tracking code

1. In your ActiveCampaign account, **click Website > Site Tracking.**
2. **Click the code** in the "Tracking Code" box.
3. **Copy the code and paste it** to the footer of each page on your website you wish to track.

We recommend placing the code in the footer because this is the easiest way of having site tracking work on all pages. However, we recommend reviewing the documentation provided by your Content Management System (CMS) to make sure the placement of the code is correct.

If you are using a WordPress site, please see our [WordPress plugin article](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/222475388) for more information on using Site Tracking with WordPress.
